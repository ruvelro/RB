"La rebelion de las bichas", a RPGMaker Game

Rise of the bichas (or RB for friends) is an RPG created by RW Labs (ruvelro, edkalrio and fegarur). The game itself is quite complicated to understand, but it could be catalogued as a humor / satire.

The main character is Isaac. At the beginning of the game he is on the banks of Marmitaco river when it starts to rain. After going to his house and see strange things, he arrives to a city where he had not been before. There, along with a group of adventurers, he travels to the world of Xon with the purpose of killing the Bichas, led by the Speed Bicha, to maintain the integrity of their world.

Enter the world of Xon under the identity of Isaac and test your warrior and language skills in this 'great' game with more than 3000 downloads!

The game dates from 2006-2007 and it is probably the first project carried out by RW Labs. After 8 years on the net, we will finally publish all the game source code to run in Game Maker XP.
